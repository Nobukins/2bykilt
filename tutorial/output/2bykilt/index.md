# Tutorial: 2bykilt

This project, **2bykilt**, is a tool that uses *Artificial Intelligence* (specifically Large Language Models or LLMs) to **control a web browser**.
You can give it tasks in plain English (like "find the latest news about AI") or run predefined scripts.
The AI agent then *figures out the steps* (like clicking buttons, typing text) needed to complete the task in the browser.
It also includes a special mode for *deep research* that automates searching, gathering, and summarizing information into a report.
