suppressions:
  "GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v":
    reason: "urllib3 redirect suppression at PoolManager level; fix requires urllib3>=2.5.0 which conflicts with botocore/boto3 (requires <2.4). Mitigation: we do not use PoolManager-level retries to disable redirects; requests-level redirect control applies."
    added_at: "2025-09-10"
    expires_at: "2026-03-31"

  "GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5":
    reason: "urllib3 Pyodide/browser redirect control; not applicable to our server/runtime. Fix requires urllib3>=2.5.0 which conflicts with AWS SDK constraint (<2.4)."
    added_at: "2025-09-10"
    expires_at: "2026-03-31"

  "GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj":
    reason: "h11 chunked-coding leniency; fix requires h11>=0.15 but httpcore==1.0.7 requires h11<0.15. Our stack uses httpcore/httpx client, not a reverse proxy; combined exploit scenario not applicable. Will upgrade when httpcore relaxes pin."

  # Example: Suppress a known false positive
  # "CVE-2023-12345":
  #   reason: "False positive - vulnerability does not affect our usage"
  #   added_at: "2025-09-08"
  #   expires_at: "2026-09-08"

  # Example: Suppress based on package and version
  # "package-name@1.2.3":
  #   reason: "Accepted risk - no viable upgrade path"
