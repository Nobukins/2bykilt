# PR #330 — refactor/issue-326-split-bykilt

Summary
-------
This PR refactors the large monolithic `bykilt.py` into smaller, focused modules, improves code quality, and adds development tooling and documentation. The aim is to increase maintainability and enable incremental improvements while preserving existing behavior.

Why
---
`bykilt.py` had grown into a large monolith (~3,888 lines at the start of the effort) with duplicate code and tightly coupled responsibilities (CLI, UI, browser agent, helpers). This made the file hard to maintain and review. The refactor follows a pragmatic "quality over line-count" approach: rather than aggressively shrinking the file, we focused on extracting clear modules, adding tests/docs/configs, and avoiding risky behavioral changes.

What changed (high level)
-------------------------
- Extracted modules
  - `src/cli/batch_commands.py` — Batch processing CLI handlers and parsers
  - `src/cli/main.py` — Application entry point and CLI orchestration
  - `src/ui/helpers.py` — UI helper functions and LLMS handling utilities
  - `src/ui/browser_agent.py` — Browser automation and agent orchestration
- `bykilt.py` remains the UI surface (Gradio wiring) but with cleaner structure and explicit imports from the new modules.

- Code quality
  - Reordered imports to be PEP 8 compliant
  - Added module docstrings and section headers for readability
  - Introduced initial type hints on major functions (gradual rollout)
  - Removed duplicate code paths and unused imports
  - Applied `black` formatting and updated `.pylintrc` for practical constraints

- Tests & verification
  - Verified imports for all refactored modules
  - Ran CLI + batch-related tests: `pytest -k "cli or batch"` → **158/158 passed**
  - Baseline coverage exported to `coverage.xml` (global coverage ~25%)

- Developer tooling & docs
  - Added `.pylintrc` — Pragmatic lint config (max-line-length=120, max-module-lines increased)
  - Added `mypy.ini` — Mypy config with third-party ignores for UI libs
  - Added `requirements-dev.txt` — Linting, typing, testing and profiling tools
  - Added `docs/development/DEV_TOOLS_SETUP.md` — Install & run steps, IDE integration, pre-commit guidance
  - Added `docs/refactoring/PHASE_6_TEST_REPORT.md` — Full verification report for Phase 6

Files added / modified
----------------------
- Added:
  - `src/cli/batch_commands.py`
  - `src/cli/main.py`
  - `src/ui/helpers.py`
  - `src/ui/browser_agent.py`
  - `.pylintrc`, `mypy.ini`, `requirements-dev.txt`
  - `docs/development/DEV_TOOLS_SETUP.md`
  - `docs/refactoring/PHASE_6_TEST_REPORT.md`
  - `docs/pr/PR_330_BODY.md` (this file)

- Modified:
  - `bykilt.py` — reorganized imports, added docstrings, type hints; retained Gradio wiring

Migration notes
---------------
- The Gradio UI remains in `bykilt.py` because Gradio elements must be created in the `gr.Blocks` context; extracting tabs is infeasible without major architecture changes (see ADR-001 in documentation).
- Some imports remain conditional/lazily loaded in `bykilt.py` for performance and to avoid heavy third-party imports at module import time.
- `.pylintrc` was adjusted to allow a slightly larger `max-module-lines` since `bykilt.py` remains large due to UI wiring. Future work should keep extracting units where feasible.

Testing performed
-----------------
- Import checks: All modules import successfully (manual sanity checks)
- CLI help smoke tests: `python3 bykilt.py --help`, `python3 bykilt.py batch --help` worked
- Pytest selected tests: `pytest tests/ -k "cli or batch" -v --tb=short` → `158 passed, 687 deselected`
- Linting & typing: `.pylintrc` and `mypy.ini` added; tools not installed in CI by default. See DEV_TOOLS_SETUP.md for local setup steps.

Quality gates & status
----------------------
- Unit tests (selected): PASS (158/158)
- Import tests: PASS
- Linting: `.pylintrc` added; we ran local pylint after formatting and config tuning (score improved to ~8.2/10)
- Type checking: `mypy` config added; there are outstanding type errors to address in a follow-up iteration

Remaining work / follow-ups
---------------------------
- Gradual addition of type hints across modules and resolving mypy findings
- Remove remaining conditional imports where safe
- Add UI integration tests (Playwright) to increase coverage for UI components
- Add pre-commit hooks in CI and local development to enforce formatting and linting
- Move more functionality out of `bykilt.py` incrementally if feasible without breaking Gradio constraints

Notes for reviewers
------------------
- Focus review on module boundaries and public APIs added by the extracted modules.
- The goal here is _behavioral parity_ with prior `bykilt.py` while improving maintainability. Pay attention to edge-case behaviors.
- If you find regressions during testing, flag them and we can revert the formatting commit and iterate with unit tests to narrow the change.

Sign-off
--------
- Refactor performed on branch: `refactor/issue-326-split-bykilt`
- Latest commit: `b1cf871` (formatting & pylint config adjustments)
- PR status: Ready for review
