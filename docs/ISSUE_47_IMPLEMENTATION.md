# Issue #47 Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented **Issue #47: Parallel execution queue & concurrency limits** as part of Phase2-01 concurrent execution control.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. QueueManager Class (`src/runner/queue_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized queue management for concurrent execution control
- **Key Features**:
  - Configurable max concurrency with semaphore-based control
  - Priority-based queue using heapq for efficient ordering
  - Thread-safe operations with comprehensive locking
  - Async execution support with proper event loop handling
  - Comprehensive statistics tracking and logging

#### 2. QueueItem Dataclass
- **Purpose**: Type-safe representation of queue items with state tracking
- **Features**:
  - State management (WAITING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
  - Priority-based comparison for queue ordering
  - Timing tracking (created_at, started_at, completed_at)
  - Metadata support for extensibility

#### 3. Manifest Integration
- **Purpose**: Queue state reflection in artifacts for monitoring and debugging
- **Features**:
  - Real-time queue state updates in manifest v2
  - Periodic statistics logging
  - Event-based logging to individual run directories
  - JSON-formatted logs for easy parsing

### Key Features Implemented

#### ✅ Configurable Concurrency Limits
- Dynamic max_concurrency setting via configuration system
- Runtime concurrency adjustment capability
- Semaphore-based execution control

#### ✅ Priority-Based Execution
- Higher priority items executed first
- FIFO ordering for same-priority items
- Efficient heap-based queue implementation

#### ✅ Comprehensive State Tracking
- Real-time queue status monitoring
- Detailed execution statistics (wait times, run times)
- Event logging for all state transitions

#### ✅ Async Execution Support
- Full asyncio compatibility
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Background statistics logging

#### ✅ Manifest Integration
- Queue state persistence in artifacts
- Historical statistics tracking
- Debug-friendly logging format

### Configuration Integration

The QueueManager integrates with the existing configuration system:

```python
# Configuration loading
config = load_config()
max_concurrency = config.get("runner", {}).get("max_concurrency", 3)

# QueueManager initialization
manager = get_queue_manager(max_concurrency=max_concurrency)
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage
```python
from src.runner.queue_manager import get_queue_manager

# Get queue manager
manager = get_queue_manager()

# Start stats logging
await manager.start_stats_logging()

# Enqueue items with priorities
manager.enqueue("task-1", "High priority task", priority=5)
manager.enqueue("task-2", "Normal task", priority=3)

# Execute items
item = await manager.execute_next()
# ... process item ...
manager.complete_item(item.id, success=True)
```

#### Advanced Monitoring
```python
# Get real-time status
status = manager.get_queue_status()
stats = manager.get_queue_stats()

print(f"Active: {status['running_count']}")
print(f"Queued: {status['queue_length']}")
print(f"Avg wait: {stats['avg_wait_time']:.2f}s")
```

### Testing Coverage

Comprehensive test suite implemented (`tests/test_queue_manager.py`):
- ✅ Basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, complete)
- ✅ Priority ordering verification
- ✅ Concurrency limit enforcement
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Configuration integration
- ✅ Async execution patterns
- ✅ Statistics accuracy

**Test Results**: 14/14 tests passing

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/runner/queue_manager.py` - Core QueueManager implementation
- `tests/test_queue_manager.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `examples/queue_manager_example.py` - Usage examples and demonstrations

#### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Added QueueManager documentation and usage examples

### Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficiency**: O(n) space complexity for queue storage
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) for enqueue/dequeue operations (heap-based)
- **Concurrency**: Configurable semaphore-based limits
- **Monitoring**: Minimal overhead statistics collection

### Integration Points

- **Configuration System**: Loads max_concurrency from `src.config.multi_env_loader`
- **Artifact Manager**: Integrates with manifest v2 for state persistence
- **Run Context**: Uses artifact directory from `src.runtime.run_context`
- **Logging**: Structured logging with event tracking

### Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Queue persistence across application restarts
- Advanced scheduling policies (deadlines, dependencies)
- Queue metrics dashboard integration
- Distributed queue coordination
- Queue item retry mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Parallel execution queue implemented**
✅ **Configurable concurrency limits**
✅ **Queue state logging and manifest reflection**
✅ **Async execution with semaphore control**
✅ **Thread-safe queue operations**
✅ **Comprehensive test coverage**
✅ **Documentation and examples provided**

## Conclusion

Issue #47 has been successfully implemented with a robust, scalable QueueManager that provides centralized concurrent execution control with comprehensive monitoring and state tracking capabilities. The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing 2bykilt architecture and provides a solid foundation for Phase2-01 concurrent execution requirements.
