- ✅ **Documentation**: README updates and implementation guide

## Key Features
- Priority queue using heapq (O(log n) operations)
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- Configuration integration for max_concurrency
- Manifest v2 integration for state persistence
- Real-time statistics and monitoring

## Testing
- 451 tests passed in full test suite
- 14 QueueManager-specific tests all passing
- No regressions in existing functionality

Closes #47
