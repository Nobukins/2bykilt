"""Legacy browser args/config validation tests (moved).

Note:
- This legacy file remains at repo root for reference but is excluded from
  pytest discovery by tests/pytest.ini (testpaths=tests).
- The active tests live in tests/unit/test_browser_config_args_validation.py.
- Keeping this file alongside tests with the same basename can confuse caches;
  it now contains no executable test code.
"""

# No tests or executable code here on purpose.
